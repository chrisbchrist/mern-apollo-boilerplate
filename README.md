A portfolio generator app built with the MERN stack using TypeScript and GraphQL with Apollo Server/Client.  UI is built mostly with Ant Design's React component library and Formik/Yup for forms and validation.

Uses JSON web tokens in local storage for simple authentication/authorization, and Github profile integration through OAuth for accessing its API.  Portfolios are currently generated as downloadable HTML files rendered from EJS templates.
