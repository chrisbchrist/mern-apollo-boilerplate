A portfolio generator app built with the MERN stack using TypeScript and GraphQL with Apollo Server/Client.  UI is built mostly with Ant Design's React component library and Formik/Yup for forms and validation.

Uses JSON web tokens in local storage for simple authentication/authorization, and Github profile integration through OAuth for accessing its API.  Portfolios are currently generated as downloadable HTML files rendered from EJS templates.

Supports OAuth through Github to integrate repos as portfolio projects automatically, as well as high quality photos through the Pexels API and custom gradients courtesy of uigradients.com for styling options.
