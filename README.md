A MERN app boilerplate with GraphQL/Apollo for future projects configured following [Sysgears' Guide](https://sysgears.com/articles/how-to-create-an-apollo-react-express-application/). I resolved issues with webpack and import paths, added Typescript support and authentication with GraphQL/JSON Web Tokens that may or may not be secure.
